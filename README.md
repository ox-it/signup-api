# Sign-up API

Not much here yet. Planning happening in the wiki.

## Overview

A project to provide an API and clients for easy sign-ups using the University Card and compatible reading devices (e.g. NFC-capable phones and barcode scanners). Will be useful for:

* Recording lecture/seminar/course attendance
* Collecting email addresses for adding to a mailing list at Freshers' Fair
